# What is Web3.js?

The web3.js library is a JavaScript package used to interact with the Ethereum platform. It is possible to interact with network nodes using raw HTTP requests, but this is impractical and error-prone. This library encapsulates and abstracts the specifics of the interaction with the clients and makes it easy to interact with the network.

A few examples of things you can do with the web3.js library are:

- Getting network data, such as block number and transaction statuses
- Automating interaction with addresses
- Building the middleware between wallets and remote clients
